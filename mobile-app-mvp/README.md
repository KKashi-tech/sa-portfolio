# Mobile Application MVP — System Analysis Case Study

## Project Overview
This project represents a system analysis case study for Smart Home mobile application. 
Key Goals of the project are: structure business and user needs, define MVP scope and priorities, translate requirements into structured system artefacts and prepare artefacts for development, design and testing phases.

## My role
* Identify key user goals and business objectives
* Define MVP scope using prioritization techniques
* Define acceptance criteria and usage scenarios
* Create key analytical artefacts required for further design and development: system requirements, UI prototype, testing plan

## Key Output Artefacts
- User Story Map (Miro)
- Structured requirements (user stories, acceptance criteria, scenarios)
- DFD and ER diagrams 
- Interactive UI prototype (Figma)
- Testing Plan 
- **Markdown / PDF** — requirements and testing documentation
